# Decieve_Me_Not
python tool to check for file integrity using hash values. Any File type

NAME OF TOOL:
Decieve_Me_Not

AIM:

The tool intends to help a user to check if a file has not been compromised given he or she has a hash value of the file prior to the time they check it again.
It can also help a user just to generate a message digest they can attach with a file to help the receiver or themselves to see if the file at hand hasnâ€™t been modified in anyway thus it helps to verify integrity of files.

LANGUAGE USED AND ASSOCIATED MODULES:
The tool is made with Python 3.6
It takes advantage of the hashlib module in python and all its associated functions like hexdigest

WHAT IT CAN DO:
1.	GENERATE A HASH VALUE (MD5)
2.	COMPARE HASH VALUES OF A FILE IN YOUR PC AND INPUTED HASH VALUE
3.	ALERT YOU IF THE FILE IS STILL INTACT OR NOT


How to run it:
